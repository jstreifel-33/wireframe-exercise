### Reflections and Comments

This was fairly straightforward until it wasn't. It's funny how quickly CSS can come together, but when something doesn't style the way you want it can feel like a black box.

The page currently has issues with the nav at the top disappearing if the window is resized to be less than ~1000px wide. I'm still working on finding a fix but had to publish as-is for the sake of time.
